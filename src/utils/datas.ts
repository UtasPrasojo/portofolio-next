By leveraging the lightweight and low-cost ESP32-CAM for image capture and wireless data transmission, and processing the visual data with YOLOv3 via OpenCV, this solution provides a real-time, efficient, and scalable monitoring tool for farmers. The system can also be connected to a web-based interface for live streaming and alert notifications, supporting precision agriculture and enhancing field productivity.",
